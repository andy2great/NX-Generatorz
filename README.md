## NxGeneratorz

This is a project containing generators based off of the amazing [@angular-architects/ddd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/ddd) package.

It's intent is to simplify the usage of the existing generators, from looking like this:

![angular architects domain example](./docs/images/angular-architext-example.png)

To something like this!

![puffyfish domain example](./docs/images/puffyfish-domain.png)

Helps keep the "Do I want my domain to be internal, buildable or publishable?" questions away ;)

| Generator | Default Options                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Domain    | standalone = false; type = buildable |
| Feature   | Text                                 |
| UI        | Text                                 |
| Util      | Text                                 |
| API       | Text                                 |
| Shell     | Text                                 |
| Rename    | Text                                 |
